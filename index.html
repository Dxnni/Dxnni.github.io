<h1>Privacy Policy of PowerTrip</h1>

<p>This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of 
    Personal Information if anyone decided to use our game.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>We do collect and store information from our players if they choose to create an account. For accounts, players can choose to
    provide a username, email address, and password. The passwords are always encrypted and are never legible. The information is
    never shared and they are used solely for login purposes so that players can use the same account across any device.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We value your trust in providing us your business, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of 
    protecting you and your privacy. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure 
    and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>All information stored from player accounts can be deleted by each player. First, a player must login to the account that they
    want to be deleted. From the main menu, the player can select the button with their username to go to their account page. The
    player must enter their password and select the "Delete account" button and then select the confirmation "YES" button to delete
    all account data. The player will be logged out and all information tied to the account is deleted.</p>

<p>If a player is unable to login to be able to delete their information, try to reset the password by selecting the "Forgot Password"
    button from the "Log in" menu. If a player did not provide an email address for the account and are still unable to login, please
    submit a username deletion request to phantmgaming8@gmail.com with the exact username for the account to be deleted. The account
    will be searched and if the account is found to have no email, then all information will be deleted. If the account is found to
    have an email, the information will not be deleted and the email will not be shared for security purposes. It is expected for the
    account to be deleted only by the owner of the email using the steps above.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We 
    will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after
